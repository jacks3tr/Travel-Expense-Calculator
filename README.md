# Travel-Expense-Calculator
Helps estimate project/program travel-related budgets for multiple events or trips by inputting customizable rates (e.g., average flight cost, car rental daily, hotel nightly, hourly commute value, food per day, and seasonal variance) and event details (e.g., name, # of trips, days, people, cars, and hours if you bill inbound/outbound time).
