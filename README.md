The Travel Expense Calculator is an open-source desktop application built in Python using the CustomTkinter library for a modern GUI. It helps users estimate project/program travel-related budgets for multiple events or trips by inputting customizable rates (e.g., average flight cost, car rental daily, hotel nightly, hourly commute value, food per day, and seasonal variance percentage) and event details (e.g., name, number of trips, days, people, cars, and round-trip hours if you bill for inbound/outbound time). 

**Key features include:**
-Dynamic event rows with add/delete/copy functionality for easy management.
-Real-time validation and auto-calculation on input changes, with debouncing to prevent performance issues.
-Tabbed summary and details views showing breakdowns (flights, cars, hotels, food, commute, variance, totals).
-Save/load configurations in JSON format.
-Theme switching (light/dark) and clipboard copying for summaries/details/events.

This tool is ideal for people scoping business travel, event planners, or anyone tracking group travel costs. It's designed for simplicity and extensibility, running locally without internet needs.
